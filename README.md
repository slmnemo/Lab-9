Hi, if you're reading this and you are currently in a Harvey Mudd class related to digital electronic and computer architecture, click off and close this tab. That's what the honor code would want you to do.

If you are still reading this, please reconsider your actions. You will have to decipher my code. Barely anything is commented, and that is by design.
Do not steal my shit please.

Thank you.
